This folder contains the schematics for the Hall Effect VR Glove. The schematic showcases the interconnections between the various sensors, the Arduino microcontroller, and the multiplexer.

## Overview

The schematic depicts:
- Hall Effect Sensors and their placements for each finger joint.
- Wiring and connections between each sensor, the Arduino, and the multiplexer.
- Distinctive wire colors representing different finger joints.

## Viewing the Schematic

To understand the schematic in detail, please zoom in on the image, which will allow you to inspect individual components and their interconnections.

## Components

1. **Hall Effect Sensors:** Positioned on each finger joint to capture accurate movement.
2. **Arduino Microcontroller:** Processes the data from the sensors and communicates with the VR system or other interfaces.
3. **Multiplexer:** Used to increase the number of analog input pins available for the sensors.
4. **Wiring:** Wires are color-coded based on their connection to specific finger joints.

## Wiring Guide

- **Red Wires:** Indicates sensors positioned on the distal phalanx (third joint) of the fingers.
- **Green Wires:** Represents sensors on the middle phalanx (second joint).
- **Blue Wires:** Denotes sensors on the proximal phalanx (first joint).
- **Purple Wires:** Used for sensors on the thumb's metacarpal.

## Assembly Note

While the schematic provides a comprehensive view of the hardware setup, please refer to the main repository's build guide for assembly instructions and best practices.
